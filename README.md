# Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms

## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
```
The proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management Portal designed specifically to help pig and poultry farmers implement effective biosecurity practices.
This platform will serve as a centralized ecosystem where farmers, veterinarians, field officers, and policymakers can access tools, guidelines,
and real-time data necessary for disease prevention and farm management.
```
## Technical Approach
```
Frontend
React.js / Next.js
Flutter / React Native (for mobile app)
Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap
Backend
Node.js / Express
Python (for AI risk scoring models)
FastAPI (for ML microservices)
Database
PostgreSQL / MongoDB
Firebase (for authentication and real-time sync)
AI/ML Components
Risk prediction model (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting)
NLP-powered chatbot for farmer support
Additional Tools
GIS Mapping: Leaflet.js / Mapbox
Cloud: AWS / Azure / GCP
Notification system: FCM, SMS gateway
IoT integration (optional phase): temperature sensors, entry logging
```
## Feasibility and Viability
```
Technically feasible: Uses widely available technologies (React, Node, ML).
Economically feasible: Low development cost; scalable cloud infrastructure.
Operationally feasible: Designed for rural settings with low bandwidth.
Government backing: Aligns with DoAH&D goals, improving adoption.
```

## Impact and Benefits

The proposed multilingual, AI-powered crop advisory solution has the potential to create transformative impact on India’s small and marginal farmers, who constitute over 86% of the agricultural workforce. These farmers often operate with limited resources, low literacy levels, and minimal access to scientific guidance, relying instead on traditional practices or informal advice from local shopkeepers. By introducing a mobile-based advisory system that delivers personalized, real-time insights in regional languages and supports voice interaction, the solution directly addresses these barriers. It empowers farmers to make informed decisions about crop selection, pest control, fertilizer application, and market timing—decisions that can significantly improve productivity, reduce input costs, and enhance income. The inclusion of image-based pest and disease detection further enables farmers to identify threats early and take corrective action, minimizing crop loss and improving yield quality. Moreover, weather-based alerts and predictive insights help farmers prepare for climate variability, reducing vulnerability to extreme conditions and fostering resilience.

Beyond individual empowerment, the solution offers wide-ranging social, economic, and environmental benefits. Socially, it promotes digital inclusion by making advanced agricultural knowledge accessible to farmers regardless of literacy or language. The voice-enabled interface ensures that even those unfamiliar with smartphones or written text can engage with the system, while multilingual support bridges linguistic divides across India’s diverse regions. This inclusivity can also extend to women farmers, who are often excluded from formal extension services, giving them direct access to advisory tools and enhancing their role in agricultural decision-making. Economically, the system helps farmers optimize input usage, reducing unnecessary expenditure on fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds. Studies have shown that ICT-based advisories can increase crop yields by 20–30%, translating into substantial income gains for smallholders. Real-time market price tracking enables farmers to make smarter selling decisions, avoid exploitation, and improve financial planning. These economic benefits ripple outward, strengthening rural economies and contributing to national food security.

Environmentally, the solution encourages sustainable farming practices by promoting balanced nutrient application and reducing chemical overuse. This helps preserve soil health, prevent water contamination, and protect biodiversity. The system’s ability to guide farmers toward climate-smart practices—such as crop rotation, organic inputs, and timely irrigation—further supports long-term ecological balance. By integrating feedback loops and usage analytics, the solution can continuously evolve, becoming more accurate and context-aware over time. In essence, this advisory platform not only uplifts individual farmers but also contributes to broader goals of environmental conservation, rural development, and agricultural modernization. It represents a scalable, inclusive, and impactful approach to transforming India’s farming landscape.
